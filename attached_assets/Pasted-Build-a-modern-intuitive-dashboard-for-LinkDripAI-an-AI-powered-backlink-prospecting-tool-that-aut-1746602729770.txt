Build a modern, intuitive dashboard for LinkDripAI, an AI‑powered backlink prospecting tool that automatically “drips” new link opportunities each day. Users unlock opportunities with credits, generate AI emails, and track outreach—all in one place. The dashboard must feel light, responsive, and guide users to action.
