Platform Name: LinkSyncOS

Business Type: SaaS platform for discovering, managing, and reaching out to backlink opportunities.

Platform Overview:


LinkSyncOS is a backlink outreach platform that helps users discover high-quality link-building opportunities tailored to their niche. The platform provides smart, AI-curated daily backlink prospect “drips” based on user-defined filters and content, allows unlocking specific opportunities using credits, and streamlines outreach with built-in AI email writing and sending.

Higher-tier plans offer more opportunities, more monthly credits, the ability to manage outreach for multiple websites, and enhanced AI recommendations.
